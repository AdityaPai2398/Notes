## Terms used in the Ethereum ecosystem and their meanings

### Public Key Cryptography
When you create an Ethereum or Bitcoin wallet the long ‘0xdf…5f’ address is a public key and the private key is stored somewhere. Private keys are used to create a digital signature on a transaction and our public keys can be used by others to know that the transaction was signed by our private key.

### Peer-to-Peer Networking
All Ethereum nodes are peers in a distributed network, there’s no centralized server [In the future, there’ll be hybrid semi-centralized services for Ethereum as a convenience to users and developers].

### Blockchain
A global ledger or simple database of all transactions, the entire history of all transactions on the network.

### Ethereum Virtual Machine
Used for executing smart contracts on a Blockchain (programmes that run on a Blockchain).

### Node
One can run a node and through it read and write to the Ethereum blockchain, i.e., use the Ethereum Virtual Machine. A full node has to download the entire blockchain. Light nodes are possible but in the works.

### Miner
A node on the network that mines, i.e., works to process blocks on the blockchain.

### Proof of work
 Miners compete to do some math problem. The first one to solve the problem (the next block on the Blockchain) wins a reward: some ether. Every node then updates to that new block. Every miner wants to win the next new block so are incentivized to keep up to date and have the one true blockchain everybody else has, so the network always achieves consensus. [The Ethereum foundation is going to migrate to a Proof of Stake algorithm without the miners].

###  Ether (ETH)
A digital currency one can buy and sell.

### Gas
A small amount of ether has to be paid to perform operations (running and storing things) on the blockchain which is known as **gas**.

### DApp
Decentralized App are what applications using smart contracts are called in the Ethereum community.
While DApps can be run from a central server if that server can talk to an Ethereum node, they can also be run locally on top of any Ethereum node peer. [They may use the blockchain to submit transactions and retrieve data (important data!) rather than a central database. Instead of a typical user login system, users may be represented by a wallet addresses and keep any user data local.]
